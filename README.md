# PSPDFKit for Salesforce Integration

## Integrate into a New Salesforce Project as a Lightning Web Component

PSPDFKit for Salesforce enables you to open PDF, JPG, PNG, and TIFF files inside Salesforce. This unlocks the full functionality of PSPDFKit in Salesforce, including PDF generation, redaction, and signatures.

This README explains how to integrate PSPDFKit into a new Salesforce project. The integration works as a [Lightning web component (LWC)][lwc] that you can add to any Salesforce organization.

For more information on integrating PSPDFKit into an existing Salesforce project, see the [PSPDFKit for Salesforce documentation][salesforce docs].

PSPDFKit for Salesforce shares the same APIs as PSPDFKit for Web Standalone. For more information on customizing your Salesforce application, see the [PSPDFKit for Web Standalone documentation][web docs].
